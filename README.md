# Ride The Bus

### Game Explanation
This is a card game where players have 6 cards facing down. The player must make a guess as to what each card will be. Once the guess is made, the first card is flipped. If they are right, they move to the second card. If they are wrong, they restart back to the first card again.

Once they reach six cards right in a row, they reach a "checkpoint". They must then go backwards, guessing 6 cards again. However, if they get a card wrong in this stretch, they fall back to the checkpoint instead of the very beginning. Once a player gets from one side, to the other, and back again, they win.

The format for card guessing is:
Card 1: Red or Black
Card 2: Higher or lower than Card 1
Card 3: Inside or Outside between the range of Card 1&2
Card 4: Red or Black
Card 5: Higher or lower than Card 4
Card 6: Inside or Outside between the range of Card 4&5
Cards 7 through 12: Same as 1 through 6.
